This project was tested using:
    python 2.7.11
    vtk 6.3.0 
    cv2 2.4.11

Edit the views/UI main_view.ui using QT Designer
Compile the UI to views/gen/ui_main_view.py using the command
	pyuic4 mvc/views/main_view.ui -o mvc/views/gen/ui_main_view.py
    
The main files to edit the actual program are 
    mvc/controller.py - The bulk of the processing is done here, including
                        button callbacks and an update thread for the
                        video. 
    mvc/model.py - Holds all the handles to the data that is manipulated
                   by the view and used by the controller
    mvc/main_view.py - Hooks ui_main_view up to the controller and the 
                       model. Also initializes the vtk widget and its
                       interactor
    mvc/vtkTools.py - Tools that help VTK and CV communicate
                      as well as tools to setup VTK for registration.
                      These are used in all three of the above files.
                      
Other files
    mvc/amoeba_annealer.py - This is an abstract function that will perform
                             downhill simplex optimization with a few
                             concepts from simulated annealing thrown in.
